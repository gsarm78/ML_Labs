      "content": "The Access and Mobility Management Function (AMF) is responsible for NAS signaling termination, UE registration management, access authentication (in conjunction with AUSF), mobility management, and UE reachability. It selects the serving SMF and enforces UE policies received via the PCF. Key interfaces include N1 (UE), N2 (gNB), N8 (UDM), N12 (AUSF), N15 (PCF), and N22 (NSSF). It operates over HTTP/2 using the SBI model with JSON payloads and secures signaling via TLS 1.2/1.3. AMF also handles paging coordination and provides NAS ciphering/integrity protection using 5G AKA parameters.",

It processes the S-NSSAI received via NAS and correlates it against slice availability within the TAI (Tracking Area Identifier) context. NSSF utilizes subscription information from the UDM and policy data from PCF to filter supported slices. It returns allowed S-NSSAIs, rejected slices with causes, and optionally suggests AMF reallocation. The interaction occurs over N31 using RESTful APIs under SBA.",

It allocates IP addresses (via DHCPv4/v6 or statically), selects UPFs based on topology and traffic steering policies (UE location, DNN, S-NSSAI), and configures forwarding rules using PFCP over N4. SMF ensures IP Session Continuity (SSC mode 1/2/3), supports UL CL functionality, and enforces QoS via QFI-to-5QI mapping. It communicates with AMF (N11), PCF (N7), and NEF/AFs (N30) to apply session and policy rules dynamically.",

It interfaces with the RAN via N3 (GTP-U), the DN via N6 (IP or VLAN), and with the SMF over N4 using PFCP for rule provisioning. Control plane functions (e.g., AMF/SMF) operate over HTTP/2, while UPF processes GTP-U encapsulated user data. UPF supports UL/DL traffic steering, session breakout, and service chaining (e.g., to NWDAF or DPI).",

For GBR flows, PCF ensures resource reservation and invokes RAN assistance via SMF and AMF.

Source AMF initiates UE context release, while the target AMF retrieves UE context, session info, and security credentials. In stateless deployments, UDSF stores UE contexts for retrieval by new AMFs without signaling the source AMF. UDSF acts as an SBA-compliant storage function, using UDSF-NF interface for stateless read/write operations.

ULCL-capable UPFs use PDRs to route UL traffic to local DNs based on packet characteristics. SMF configures ULCL via PFCP, enabling SSC mode 2/3 support, path relocation, and anchor reassignment. Anchor relocations are triggered by AMF based on UE mobility events and UE context updates, ensuring seamless session continuity.",
